## About
The goal of the CHoRUS Network is to develop the most diverse, high-resolution, ethically sourced, AI-ready data set to answer the grand challenge of improving recovery from acute illness.
<br/>
This collaboration spans 20 academic centers, of which 14 will contribute as Data Acquisition centers.
<br/>
Patient-focused efforts will determine the ethical and legal approaches to manage privacy and bias, while accounting for Social Determinants of Health.
<br/>
Unified standards will harmonize multi-modal EHR, waveform, imaging, and text data.
<br/>
A visualization and annotation environment will label data with targets important for prediction.
<br/>
A comprehensive set of approaches will develop the skills and workforce for a next generation of diverse academic and community AI scientists.
<br/>
Federated access will enable sampling methods to ensure a balanced and diverse cohort.
<br/>
Collaborating with Bridge2AI and 3 other data generation projects, the CHoRUS Network will help us cross the Bridge2AI network together.

## Modules

The module aims to harmonize, standardize, de-identify, and collect data from CHoRUS sites, providing tools to support the data acquisition process and customization for site-specific workflows. The approach involves integrating newly developed and existing AI/ML tools, ensuring they can be readily integrated into the Bridge2AI program data ecosystem. Key principles and innovations guiding the effort include a cloud-centric design, support for loosely coupled modules, and exposed APIs for integration.

### Tools (TM)

Research infrastructure and Tooling module at CHoRUS sites will be elevated through the deployment of tools such as OMOP mapping and physiological data conversion. The focus is on secure and responsible access to the CHoRUS data and tools, with hosting on a cloud-based data platform and integration with the NIH Researcher Auth Service (RAS) for authorized access.

Transparency and reproducibility in AI/ML research are promoted through tools that enable persistent identification of artifacts in projects, a dedicated interpretable AI toolbox, and a model performance evaluation toolbox to generate model cards.

The module emphasizes community-based collaborations, including features for streamlined cohort adjudication and data annotation, and modular CHoRUS AI/ML toolboxes that benefit from active community contributions. Integration with PhysioNet is also supported to engage the broader PhysioNet user community.

The CHoRUS dataset and tools are designed to be accessible to users of all levels of AI/ML and clinical knowledge literacy. An integrated viewer (IVe) and canonical AI/ML models for Critical Care use cases are among the tools developed to provide intuitive and informative access to the dataset for users with broad clinical and technical expertise.

### Data Acquisition (DA)

The Data Acquisition module oversees the process of data generation from all data contributing sites to CHoRUS. This site describes the process of acquiring data, any specific requirements or formats, and any tools or methods used for data acquisition, and tracking data acquisition. Standard operating procedures are offered to guide data acquisition. 

In addition to discussions pertaining to specific aspects of the data acquisition process, the DA office hour, held every Friday at 2 pm is the forum of choice to share information related to DA.
